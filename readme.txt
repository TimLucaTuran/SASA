SASA means "Semi Analytic Stacking Algorithm".

Documentation:

https://sasa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#


Functionality:

- create stack out of diffferent materials (meta-materials and non-meta-materials (isotropic and anisotropic))
  and get physical information out of the system (contained in the S-Matrix of the system)
- simulate different heights of a single homogeneous material
- output of several terms of the series expansion of the reflecting term in the star-product, to better understand
  the impact of resonances between interfaces inside the stack

User Calls:

- example of a stack out of 4 layers (two metamaterials and two isotropic SiO2 layers):
